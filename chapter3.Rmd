**FIRST, I created a new R Markdown file**, named it as 'chapter3.Rmd', and saved it to my folder. Then, I included the new file as a child file in my 'index.Rmd' file.

**SECOND, I read the joined and modified 'alc' data into R from my local folder, and described it briefly.**

```{r}
library(readr)
setwd("C:/Users/ariv/Documents/IODS-project/IODS-project/data")
alc <- read_csv("alc.csv")
View(alc)
```
```{r}
colnames(alc)[2:36]
```

The **alc** data set describes students of two Portuguese schools, their age, gender, socio-demographics, free-time including alcohol use, health status, etc. The data set consists of 370 students and 35 variables. Prof. **Paulo Cortez** (http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/Home.html) is the provider of the original data set (**Student Performance Data Set**, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance).
