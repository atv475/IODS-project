## Thoughts about IODS2021

I noticed this course last year when it advertised itself in UEFâ€™s Yammer.

So far, I have carried out the following tasks:

1. I watched the webinars by Garrett Grolemund regarding RStudio and GitHub.
2. I installed R, RStudio, and Git to my computer.
3. I created an account on GitHub, a GitHub repository for the IODS-project [https://github.com/atv475/IODS-project], and a course diary web page [https://atv475.github.io/IODS-project/].
4. I successfully completed R Short and Sweet on Nov 2, 2021.

*Now I am learning R Markdown*. At first, I struggled with it but, fortunately, I found some informative YouTube videos that showed me the very basics. I have never used R Markdown before.

The structure of IODS2021 is well-thought and clear so I believe the course will flow smoothly. However, I expected to hear more about **the reasoning of the course**. Why Open Data Science is important, and why should we learn these technical skills, such as RStudio?
